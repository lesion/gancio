    "title": "About",
    "content": "About Gancio was born in Italy from political hacking movements, in particular from the hacklab underscore. We deal not only with technology but also with politics because we believe that technology is not neutral, that the Internet can also become an instrument of oppression, that information and software must be free and that knowledge is not for sale. For us, hacking is study and sharing, it is conscious and unconventional use of tools. In 2018 we set up a “radical local server” cisti.org that hosts services explicitly designed for local people / movements / groups / collectives and it is NOT our intention to grow. In fact, we believe that one of the main issues of technology is the scale. We liked very much the idea of the federation and following the example of our brothers and sisters in bologna (the bida.im collective) we setup a mastodon instance as a first service. The next step was to host a shared calendar, but as we didn’t find anything that would fit, we decided to write it ourselves.",

Gancio should send emails at following events: the admin should receive emails of anon event (if enabled) to confirm them. the admin should receive emails of registration request (if enabled) to confirm them. an user should receive an email of registration requested. an user should receive an email of confirmed registration. an user should receive a confirmation email when subscribed directly by admin. &quot;smtp&quot;: { &quot;auth&quot;: { &quot;user&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;&quot; }, &quot;secure&quot;: true, &quot;host&quot;: &quot;&quot; } Admin_email Email of administrator. Note that email from gancio comes from this email and that the SMTP configuration above should allow to use this address as from. Favicon You could specify another favicon. This is also used as logo (top-left corner): &quot;favicon&quot;: &quot;./favicon.ico&quot; User locale Probably you want to modify some text for your specific community, that’s why we thought the user_locale configuration: you can specify your version of each string of gancio making a directory with your locales inside. For example, let’s say you want to modify the text inside the /about page: mkdir /opt/gancio/user_locale put something like this in /opt/gancio/user_locale/en.js to override the about in english: export default { about: &#39;A new about&#39; } and then point the user_locale configuration to that directory: &quot;user_locale&quot;: &quot;/opt/gancio/user_locale&quot; Watch here for a list of strings you can override. :warning: Note that a restart is needed when you change user_locale’s content.

Events are not published with the type Event but with type Note because we wanted to add the possibility to interact with events from mastodon instances (boost / bookmark and “comments” that we call resources because we don’t want it to become a place of debate, but more a place where to keep a historical memory of events, e.g. an audio recording of a talk).

Get started now Demo Source Some relevant key features: Focus on content not on people: nowhere on gancio appears the identity of who published the event, not even under a nickname, not even to administrators (except in the db). This is not an ego-friendly platform. Visitors first. We do not want logged user to get more features than random visitor. We do not want users to register, except to publish events and even in this case you can publish an anonymous event. Anonymous events: optionally a visitor can create events without being registered (an administrator has to confirm them) We are not interested in making hits so we export events in many ways, via RSS feeds, via global or individual ics, incorporating lists of events or single event via iframe on other websites. Very easy UI Multidays events support (festival, conferences…) Recurrent events support (each monday, each two monday, each monday and friday, each two saturday, etc.) Filters events for tags or places RSS and ICS export (with filters) embeddable iframe (example) boost / bookmark / comment events from the fediverse!
