== Description ==
This plugin allows you to [embed](https://gancio.org/usage/embed) a list of events or a single event from your [Gancio](https://gancio.org) website using a shortcode.
It also allows you to connects a [Gancio](https://gancio.org) instance to a your wordpress website to automatically push events published on Wordpress:
for this to work an event manager plugin is required, only [Event Organiser](https://wp-event-organiser.com/) is supported but adding another plugin it's an easy task.
